# Composition and resource coexistence

Fragments that pass alone can fail when composed. Track at least:

- main plus altstack peak, including unrelated live state;
- table lifetime and cleanup ordering;
- item size and numeric encoding at each boundary;
- conversion between byte, nibble, limb, field, and RNS layouts;
- clean-stack terminal behavior;
- tapscript validation budget and transaction weight;
- whether relaxed execution was used.

A protocol map should annotate every edge with its stack representation and
trust status. Setup amortization is valid only if table memory can remain live
across all intervening operations.
