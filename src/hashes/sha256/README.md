# SHA-256

SHA-256 compression exposed through u32 and u4 stack representations. The
`sha2_*` prefix names the SHA-2 family implementation while this directory fixes
the concrete algorithm to SHA-256.

## Parameters

- Message length is supplied at script-generation time.
- `sha2_u32`: one byte per stack item internally; optimized paths exist for 32
  and 80 bytes. The documented default is 32 bytes.
- `sha2_u4`: two nibbles per input byte and optional addition-table use chosen
  from the block count. The documented default is 32 bytes.
- `sha2_u4_stack`: the tracked-stack generator additionally selects addition
  tables and full/half XOR tables; defaults in its size tests are enabled.

## Script metrics

Sizes are hashing fragments only. They exclude message pushes/witness bytes and
output comparison.

| Implementation | 32-byte input script |
| --- | ---: |
| `sha2_u32` | <!-- metric:sha2_u32_32 -->512428<!-- /metric:sha2_u32_32 --> bytes |
| `sha2_u4` | <!-- metric:sha2_u4_32 -->332942<!-- /metric:sha2_u4_32 --> bytes |

Both fragments exceed the repository optimizer's 32 KiB input cutoff and are
reported unoptimized.

Maximum stack depth depends on input length and implementation. The
`sha2_u4_stack` generator records it with `StackTracker`; executable hash tests
cover the u32 and u4 layouts.

## Security

SHA-256 provides a 256-bit output, with generic 128-bit collision resistance
and 256-bit preimage/second-preimage resistance. These claims assume canonical
SHA-256 use; they do not authenticate witness data by themselves.

## Script compatibility and standardness

The opcode vocabulary is shared by legacy script and tapscript, but the
generated scripts are large and operation-heavy. Practical use is tapscript or
research execution; many configurations exceed P2SH/P2WSH/bare policy or
legacy limits. The caller must append output verification and cleanstack logic.

## Witness and hints

No hints are required. `sha2_u32` consumes one stack item per byte;
`sha2_u4` consumes two canonical nibbles per byte in the order documented by
the push helpers.
